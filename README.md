# pronomy-bot
discord.py is no longer supported and my discord server basically died, so i'll do something in the future a bit different, but no discord bot for sometime

a bot for my discord server

libs: discord.py and .env

i don't remember why, but i made a logging log, but i dont really care since it's made to run only one in a server

.env is for internal references and some code-dry

i made this rep only in case someone steals my computer
